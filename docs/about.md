![Javier Tinoco Diaz]

Hi, my name is Javier. I´m from Mexico, I've been working in GFT Mexico since 2020 at 
Santander Bank.

Many people know me as a Backend Developer who enjoys working with Java´s Stack Tecnologies.  

In this website I talk about what interests me. Rigth now my major interest is coding, so most of the posts are about coding. Hope you'll find something useful/inspiring here, and thanks for reading.
